I am quite inspired by the late Christopher Hitchens. He defined his life in many ways with his writings on politics, contrarianism, and religion. His book *Letters to a young contrarian* has been a much bigger part of my life than I would dare to admit. The essence of the book can be summed up as follows:

> You should try to live your life as if you were a free person, not having to wonder what everyone's opinion was. That you should take the risk of being the only person believing what you believe in and that still might mean that you were right; that if the majority believes a certain way, it makes it more likely than not to be wrong.

In a way, it could be considered a call to arms. Are there truths I consider to be self-evident that are everything but? What basis do I have for my morality and view of the world? 

I find that there is common and established knowledge that I reject. Ideas that would be controversial to some, but why would that matter? Is the crowd inheriently wise or mad? I am not an ideology. I reject the mental prison that it creates, forcing people to follow a road map for their beliefs. In a way, I am here to create my own.<br>

I see there is a great need for people today to speak up. Society has grown scared of speaking its mind. And we do not realize how important it is for everyone to make their voice heard. I keep asking myself: *If I am too scared to speak, who will speak on my behalf?* So let me ask you this:

***How tolerant is a society when ideologies break families apart?***

***How good is criticism when hidden behind a black screen?***

***How good is a democracy with a silent majority?***

Politics is a big topic today. However, I do not want this to be a discussion of current affairs. I want to explore our systems be they political, societal, or technological. This is a place for exploration of ideas, contrarianism, and questioning. 

I invite you to question these ideas, to criticize me for my shortcomings, and my biases. How good is an explorer with a map only partially filled in? and that refuses to explore?

In a way, it is a call to arms, but we will leave that for another time<br>

<br>So let's ask the question again.

***Why did I create 21st-century man?***

I find myself wanting to write more, explore my ideas more, to formulate them better. 

This is my place for exploration.
